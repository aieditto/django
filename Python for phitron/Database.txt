//Datebase management System.
Module 1
Table and keys
There are 3types of key 
1. Primary key
2. Composite primary key
3. Foreign key

Primary key: কোনো একটা কি এর আন্ডারে যদি কোনো ডাটা থাকে তাহলে
সেটা প্রাইমারী কি.

1------Rahim
2---- Karim

Composite Primary key: If there are more than 2 data field use 
as a key because 1 data field are not enough for collect the correct information
that combining key are composite primary key.

1----CSE---Rahim
2----SWE----Karim
3-----CSE---Maria

Foreign Key:
If other table key is use for another table key that are called
foreign key.
1----CSE            2---Karim
2----cw               1-----rahim


Module: 1.6 DBMS and RDBMS
DBMS: Database management System
DBMS
!-----Data/information
!-----Hardware
!----Software
!----user
!-----processing unit 


1. Data are 
2. Create label
3. Rename label
4. Update
5. Query
Benifit of DBMS
1. organizely data storing
2. fast search
3. parallel acessing
Usage of DBMS
1. Various sector use Database


Module: 1.7 RDBMS (Realational Database Management System)

Relation between two or more table.

There are 3 type of RDBMS
1. One to one Relation
2. One to many or many to one
3. Many to many



Module:2-1 Database design
   

Top down approach
Suppose top is MODEL and Down is Data
Model to data transfer

Bottom up approach
Suppose top is MODEL and Down is Data
Data to Model transfer

Pitfalls to avoid


Module: 2.2 ERD Intro and Relationship:
ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)
This diagram use for database modeling
There are 3 component for ERD:
1. Entity
2. Attribute
3. Relationship

For Example:
Suppose creating a database for Student. Now the element like
STUDENT, TEACHER, RESULT etc are entity.

Under the STUDENT entity there are many things to store for Example
ID/roll, name, contact, address so this are attritube

and the relatioship are connection between to table.

Relationship
    !
    !---1. connectivity  connection between to entity
    !---2. cardianility  (koita kore connection ache shetak bujai) 



Module: 2.3 ERD Participations, Notations, Strong weak entity
Participations (অংশগ্রহণ)
Like how many data are stay there that are called Participations

For example: All student attend on exam. So, that are Total Participations
and one are missing or didnt attend the exam. So this are partial Participations

Strong Entity: Jader nijer primary key thake tara strong entity
Weak Entity: Jader Nijer primary key na thake tara weak entitiy.
