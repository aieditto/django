Table and keys
There are 3types of key 
1. Primary key
2. Composite primary key
3. Foreign key

Primary key: কোনো একটা কি এর আন্ডারে যদি কোনো ডাটা থাকে তাহলে
সেটা প্রাইমারী কি.

1------Rahim
2---- Karim

Composite Primary key: If there are more than 2 data field use 
as a key because 1 data field are not enough for collect the correct information
that combining key are composite primary key.

1----CSE---Rahim
2----SWE----Karim
3-----CSE---Maria

Foreign Key:
If other table key is use for another table key that are called
foreign key.
1----CSE            2---Karim
2----cw               1-----rahim



                            Module: 1.6 DBMS and RDBMS

DBMS: Database management System
DBMS
!-----Data/information
!-----Hardware
!----Software
!----user
!-----processing unit 


1. Data are 
2. Create label
3. Rename label
4. Update
5. Query

Benifit of DBMS
1. organizely data storing
2. fast search
3. parallel acessing

Usage of DBMS
1. Various sector use Database


                        Module: 1.7 RDBMS (Realational Database Management System)

Relation between two or more table.

There are 3 type of RDBMS
1. One to one Relation
2. One to many or many to one
3. Many to many



                        Module:2-1 Database design
   

Top down approach
Suppose top is MODEL and Down is Data
Model to data transfer

Bottom up approach
Suppose top is MODEL and Down is Data
Data to Model transfer

2. Requirement Analysis
Requirement analysis is like what kind of data should need to store for the specific model.
Example:
            Student Database
                 |
                 |-Name
                 |-Section
                 |-Roll

3. Pitfalls (ত্রুটিসমূহ) to Avoid
    1. Redundancy (unnecessary times repeating same thing)

            if two table are connected with each other and there any data need to be changes from one table but
            their data are connected with both table so, both table data should be changed that is called Redundancy.
            to avoid Redundancy we have set that way if one table data change than other will be change it automatically.
    
    2. Lack of Completeness

            If any table has the valid data missing that means the table is not completed so this are Lack of Completeness.
       




                            Module: 2.2 ERD Intro and Relationship:

ERD(Entity Relationship Diagram)
This diagram use for database modeling
There are 3 component for ERD:
1. Entity
2. Attribute
3. Relationship

For Example:
Suppose creating a database for Student. Now the element like
STUDENT, TEACHER, RESULT etc are entity.

Under the STUDENT entity there are many things to store for Example
ID/roll, name, contact, address so this are attritube

and the relatioship are connection between to table.

Relationship
    !
    !---1. connectivity  connection between to entity
    !---2. cardianility  (koita kore connection ache shetak bujai) 

    cardianility ----   1. One to One   ----> 1:1
                        2. One to Many  ----> 1:N
                        2. Many to Many  ----> M:N
     cardianility: How many connection are there that is called cardianility

                    
                    
                    Module: 2.3 ERD Participations, Notations, Strong weak entity

                            
                            Participations (অংশগ্রহণ)

Like how many data are join there that is called Participations

            Student             Exam
            P                   A
            Q                   B
            R                   C 
                                D
For example: 

All student attend on exam. So, this are Total Participations.
and one are missing or didn't attend the exam. So this are Partial Participations

                        ERD Notation
                        
Strong Entity: Jader nijer primary key thake tara strong entity
Weak Entity: Jader Nijer primary key na thake tara weak entitiy.
