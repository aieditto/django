Working with Static Files inside Project
Static file means  song, image, video or other thing which are 
store in main project and they are unchangeable.
So, What is the procedure?
First of all 
step 1: create a folder with name static or something
step 2: crete other folder under the static folder to store
        images, js and css folder
step 3: then take some image copy that and paste it images folder
step 4: if we try to access images django didnt allow that so it need 
        to be take permission from main project setting folder

        after that we can see **** STATIC_URL='static/'

        this means if we have a website with the name of abc.com then if we need
        to access image from images folder then the link will be: static.abc.com
        this means the file is on static folder and it communicate with STATICFILES_DIRS 
        to locate the file.

        Your project will probably also have static assets that arenâ€™t tied to a 
        particular app. In addition to using a static/ directory inside your apps, 
        you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your settings 
        file where Django will also look for static files. 
        this means this STATICFILES_DIRS use for where the images file are store For example:

        **** STATICFILES_DIRS = [
                 BASE_DIR / "static",
              ]


                        Module 3.3

Static vs Dynamic file/ Media File

Media file is changeable when a data come from
backend that is media file. 

# Base url to serve media files
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

# Path where media is stored'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
        
        By default, Django doesn't serve media files during development( when debug=True).

        In order to make the development server serve the media files open the url.py of the project and make the below changes.
url.py

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ...]
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,
                          document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

That's all now, run the local development server add files in the media root folder and retrieve them from media URL.
