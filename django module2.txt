How to create environment, install jango, project and apps and connect between them

Create Environment:
1. pip install virtualenv
2. virtualenv add_a_room(like room1)
3. source ./room1/Scripts/activate
4. To check correct or not (virtualenv --version)

install django:
1. pip install django
2. python -m django --version (to check django)

Create Project:
1. django-admin startproject project_name
2. cd project_name
3. python manage.py runserver
the it will show a link and click on that after that
a webpage will open

if i want to write there something the following steps
1. cd project_name
2. The create a file with the name of views.py because
there are no views.py to show the template or other thing
3. search the urls.py and write there 
    1. from .import views
    2. path('', views.home),
4. For connecting with the urls page now i have to import
  so write this code
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    then write a function
        def home(request):
        return HttpResponse('From Home of the main project')
        
        (HttpResponse is use for sending the response because a webpage 
        cant understand the return )

Why we create apps?
We create apps for distributing the project code
it will help to run the code faster, understandable also
less time consume etc.

Create Apps:
1. django-admin startproject project_name
2. cd project_name
3. django-admin startapp app_name

** if i want to write there something the following steps:

1. Create a file with the name of app_name

views.py because
there are no views.py to show the template or other thing
3. search the urls.py and write there

module 2.4- how to write html code from template
1. first create a project. then create a views.py name file
2. Goto urls. py and make connection between views.py
   from .import views
   path('', views.home),

3. Then create templates folder on third project 
    goto settings to declare goto template format: 
    write this 'DIRS': [BASE_DIR/'templates'],

4. Goto views.py and write
    from django.shortcuts import render
    def home(request):
    return render(request,'index.html')
5. Goto index.html file write code here and run..

            Module-2.6. Django Template Language If-Else condition
after the setting of apps template now from the views.py in the function there are
a link like 

./app_name/index.html or something write there with comma like the below example:
 return render (request,'./fifth_app/index.html/', {'author':'Anis', 'age':23})
 I can send value from here

it will be shown by template folder index.html file

Now you can write condition here like the below example:

    {%if age < 10 %}
    <p>you are dumb</p>
    {% else %}
    <p>you are nah</p>
    {% endif %}
NB: if you write *if* condition you have to must be write *endif* there

                            
                            Module 2.7 For loop

for running the for loop first I have to take data from views.py there are a function
that function store the value and share with the template file 

use this function 

{% for how_many_time_runs in the_stored_variable %}
    the other codition write here
{% endfor %}

For Example:
{% for i in count %}
    <p>{{i.id}}</p>
    <p>{{i.id}}</p>
    <p>{{i.id}}</p>
{% endfor %}

                            Module 2.8 Filtering

Filtering means some values are passing from the views.py so If we need to change any word, change or collect
any information then we can use filtering which are the feature of DTL (Django Template Language) where I can
write python code in html thats magic for more : https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/django-template-filters/

how to write filter:
{{ variable_name | filter_name }}

For Example:
{{ value | length }}
If value is [‘a’, ‘b’, ‘c’, ‘d’], the output will be 4.

    <p>
       Character of Name: {{author | length}}
       <br>
       Character of Name: {{author | upper}}
    </p>

NB: The value must need to passed from the views.py 
Character of Name: {{author | length}}
       <br>
       Character of Name: {{author | upper}}
       <br>
       <br>
       truncatewords are usually use for compressing the sentence or topic like see more continue etc.
       <br>
       blog truncatewords:<br>
       {{blog | truncatewords:5}}
               
               
               
               
                Module-3.1
There are two types of files. 1. Static File, 2. Dynamic file

Static files means that file which are store on main project and static files elements cant be changes.


Working with Static Files inside Project
Static file means  song, image, video or other thing which are 
store in main project and they are unchangeable.
So, What is the procedure?
First of all 
step 1: create a folder with name static or something
step 2: crete other folder under the static folder to store
        images, js and css folder
step 3: then take some image copy that and paste it images folder
step 4: if we try to access images django didnt allow that so it need 
        to be take permission from main project setting folder

        after that we can see **** STATIC_URL='static/'

        this means if we have a website with the name of abc.com then if we need
        to access image from images folder then the link will be: static.abc.com
        this means the file is on static folder and it communicate with STATICFILES_DIRS 
        to locate the file.

        Your project will probably also have static assets that aren’t tied to a 
        particular app. In addition to using a static/ directory inside your apps, 
        you can define a list of directories (STATICFILES_DIRS) in your settings 
        file where Django will also look for static files. 
        this means this STATICFILES_DIRS use for where the images file are store For example:

        **** STATICFILES_DIRS = [
                 BASE_DIR / "static",
              ]
    then goto html folder and try to link the images
    {% load static %} //load static means loading the static folder
    <img src="{% static 'image_link' %}" alt="">
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'link'%}">



                         Module 3.2 Static folder run from app

        almost same as the project

        

                         Module 3.3 Static vs Dynamic file/ Media File

Media file is changeable when a data come from
backend that is media file. 

# Base url to serve media files
MEDIA_URL = '/media/'

# Path where media is stored'
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
        
        By default, Django doesn't serve media files during development( when debug=True).

        In order to make the development server serve the media files open the url.py of the project and make the below changes.
url.py

from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ...]
if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.MEDIA_URL,
                          document_root=settings.MEDIA_ROOT)

That's all now, run the local development server add files in the media root folder and retrieve them from media URL.

                
                        
                        Module 3.4. Adding Bootstrap

                            Copy paste from website


                Module 3.5 Using Url tag in Django Project

path('data/',views.data, name ="information"), 
to make url tag shortcut i have to give a name of the main source link like as a information

then goto template folder and goto html file write there
on a linke like :

<a href = "{% url 'information' %}"> Data </a>


                Module 3.6 Inheritence in Django Project

If i need to do same work repeatedly it will tough for me and It will make the website slow
so we have to use inheritance method for doing this.

The html file name must be base.html
Inheritance means the way of how a child template hold all the characteristics of parent template
DRY principle (Dont Repeat Yourself)

For Example: 
                              --- About.html  
Navigtion Bar (Base.html)  ---|-- index.html
                              --- feedback.html

                Extends Tag
  {% extends "parent_template_name" %}

                Block Tag
{% block blockname %} other instruction {% endblock %}

For Example:
    from: index.html
    {% extends 'base.html'%}
    {% block article %} hello world {% endblock %}
    {% block content %} {{block.super}} The code write {%endblock%} //super keyword use for merging with parent

    from: base.html
    <html>
        <head> <title></title> </head>
        <body>
            <h1> {% block article %} {% endblock %} </h1>
            <h1> {% block content %} in python {% endblock %} </h1>
        </body>
    </html>


                    Module 4.1 Working with Html Forms in Django

First create a html forms on template folder. Then connect with base.html for DRY(Dont Repeat Yourself) 
principle for avoiding repeat code. Then goto forms file and create a form there.
After that when adding a method in <form> tag like

<form method='post'>
then there will be show CSRF error. This is a security token and the full form of CSRF is (Cross Site Request Forgery)

and it is said to occurs when a malicious Web site deceives users into unwillingly and unknowingly loading a URL from a site where they've previously been authenticated, thus exploiting their status and also putting the data at risk.

POST usually use for collect data send that data to the server and this is encrypted. Thats Why
this are use for storing personal info.

GET use for collecting data and showing others which have no harmful information or personal information.

after that add after the form tag 

                    
                {% CSRF_token %}

then goto  views.py of the apps and write there on form function. 
    
                print(request.POST)

when I entry some info on form this data send to the backend but it will show some string that is no understandable
thats why I have to goto 
        
        form.html--> search where the input are taking information write there name='username', email='email' this are like
        catching the value of send from front end. and then it will show the info at terminal.

        1. then write a condition on a function 
             if request.method=="POST":
                name=request.POST.get('username')  
                email=request.POST.get('email')  
                return render (request,'./seventh_apps/about.html', {'name': name, 'email': email})
            else: 
                return render (request,'./seventh_apps/about.html', {'name': name, 'email': email}) 

        2. go to that form.html and write there catch the value which are pass on previous line 

            <h1>Name{{name}}</h1>
            <h1>Email{{email}}</h1>
            after running it will show the value 
            but
            if I want to show this on other page then I have to copy all condition
            and paste it on that function which have a link with the page
            and then goto on the page write there the given upper code.

            then goto form.html beside the <form> tag write there action=/...../ 
            it will work perfectly.

            the process are same for other input to handling data from form.

            If GET use as a method the value will show on the link and it will breache the security
            hacker can easily hack information.
